# ðŸŒ± What is Agora?
## Agora is the Latin word for marketplace. And thatâ€™s exactly what we are. Weâ€™re here to bridge the gap between farmers growing incredibly fresh food and consumers who are looking for a streamlined platform to purchase that kind of produce.

# ðŸŒ± Why did we make this?
## Farm fresh food is often difficult to find in most cities. Existing resources often offer limited information on vendor availabilities, making it less accessible to people.
